**✨ Embedding-based Text Analysis and Sentiment Prediction ✨**
📝 Overview
This project is a deep learning-based text processing application using TensorFlow and Keras. It processes movie reviews by embedding text data, analyzing word patterns, 
and predicting sentiment. The model converts textual data into numerical embeddings, facilitating sentiment analysis and recommendation based on the embedded features.

# 🌟 Features
# 🔤 Text preprocessing and word embedding representation.
# 🧠 Model building and training with an embedding layer.
# 📊 Sentiment prediction based on movie reviews.
# 🛠️ Technologies Used
TensorFlow and Keras for building and training the deep learning model.
NumPy for data handling and manipulation.
🚀 Getting Started
# ✅ Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Python 3.6+
TensorFlow and Keras (preferably in a virtual environment)
NumPy for data handling
# 📦 Installation
Clone this repository or download the source files.
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/text-embedding-analysis.git
cd text-embedding-analysis
Set up a virtual environment and install the necessary packages:
bash
Copy code
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
# ▶️ Running the Application
Open the Jupyter notebook embeddinng.ipynb for text analysis and embedding processing.
Run main.py for review sentiment prediction.
# 📂 Code Explanation
# 🔑 Key Files
embeddinng.ipynb: Contains the main notebook for embedding-based text preprocessing.
main.py: Contains the code for review decoding, preprocessing, and sentiment prediction functions.
# 📝 Main Functions
# text_preprocessing(): Prepares text data for embedding.
# embedding_model(): Builds and compiles the model with an embedding layer.
# predict_sentiment(): Predicts the sentiment of input movie reviews.
# 🔧 Important Variables
vocab_size: Defines the vocabulary size for text embedding.
embedding_dim: Sets the dimensions of the embedding layer output.
# 🛡️ How It Works
The text data is tokenized and padded for uniform input length.
A sequential model is built with an embedding layer that learns word embeddings.
The model is trained on movie reviews, and the sentiment is predicted using predict_sentiment() in main.py.
# 🎨 Customization
Adjust embedding_dim in embedding_model() for different embedding vector sizes.
Modify padding options in text_preprocessing() for fine-tuning input sequences.
# 📸 Example Output
The application displays the model's accuracy and loss during training, followed by predictions indicating the sentiment of new reviews.

# 🔮 Future Improvements
Expand the model with LSTM or GRU layers for enhanced context processing.
Implement data augmentation for varied text inputs.
Support more comprehensive recommendation logic based on sentiment scores.
# 🛠️ Troubleshooting
Ensure all required packages are installed in the correct environment.
If issues arise with TensorFlow versions, consider downgrading/upgrading to a compatible version.
